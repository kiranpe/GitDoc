git config --global --unset http.proxy

git config --global --get http.proxy


The reason could be the firewall modification as you are under a network.(In which case they may deliberately block some ports)
To double check if this is the reason ... do

ssh -T git@github.com

this should timeout. If that's the case use http protocol instead of ssh this way
just change your url in the config file to http.
Here is how :-

git config --local -e

change entry of 
 url = git@github.com:username/repo.git
to 
url = https://github.com/username/repo.git
